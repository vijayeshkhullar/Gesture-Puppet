# Hand Gesture Puppet
This is an in progress Hand Gesture control project. It uses computer vision to detect hand gestures through the camera webcam. The detected gestures are sent to a microcontroller in which I am puppeteering a 3D printed hand that I am designing. This project can be implemented to puppeteer anything. I am using a GitHub repository originally from Kazuhito Takahashi, and translated by Nikita Kiselov which consists of the base code that maps and reads the hand gestures. The code altered is directly in the app.py file, commented depicting the arduino connection.
