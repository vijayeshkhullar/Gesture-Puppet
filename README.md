# Gesture-Puppet

This is an in progress Hand Gesture control project. It uses computer vision to detect hand gestures through the camera webcam. The detected gestures are sent to a microcontroller in which I am puppeteering a 3D printed hand that I am designing. This project can be implemented to puppeteer anything. I am using a GitHub repository originally from Kazuhito Takahashi, and translated by Nikita Kiselov which consists of the base code that maps and reads the hand gestures. I will provide the altered code and arduino code on my GitHub
